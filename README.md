# Simple user registration form & list of registered users

### For the faster development, I didn't remove any of built-in migrations and files. I just added some more files for the assessment

### Installation

- Update .env

- Run the following commands
    ```Bash
       cd register-form
       composer install
       npm install && npm run build
       
       php artisan run:setup
       
    ```
